README: Comprehensive Stroke Prediction Model

Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based stroke risk prediction model implemented in R, designed for healthcare integration and real-time clinical decision support. The model predicts the probability of stroke occurrence in individual patients using demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. It features a RESTful API deployment for seamless access from healthcare applications or electronic health records.

Data Description

Predictor Variables:
	•	Gender (Male, Female)
	•	Age (continuous, in years)
	•	Hypertension (0: No, 1: Yes)
	•	Heart Disease (0: No, 1: Yes)
	•	Marital Status (Yes, No)
	•	Work Type (Private, Self-employed, Government job, Children, Never worked)
	•	Residence Type (Urban, Rural)
	•	Average Glucose Level (continuous)
	•	BMI (continuous)
	•	Smoking Status (Never smoked, Formerly smoked, Smokes, Unknown)

Target Variable:
	•	Stroke occurrence (0: No stroke, 1: Stroke)

Installation & Setup

Requirements:
	•	R version ≥ 4.0
	•	Required R packages: plumber, caret, ROSE, xgboost, randomForest, glmnet, dplyr, tidyr, readr

Setup Steps:
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction-model.git
cd stroke-prediction-model


	2.	Install R and RStudio (if not already installed).
	3.	Install required R packages:

install.packages(c("plumber", "caret", "ROSE", "xgboost", "randomForest", "glmnet", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr"))


	4.	Load the saved model and preprocessing pipeline included in /model.
	5.	Start the Plumber API service:

library(plumber)
pr <- plumb("api/stroke_api.R")
pr$run(port = 8000)



⸻

API Usage

Once running, the API provides two primary endpoints:
	•	POST /predict
Submit patient risk factor data to receive a stroke probability and risk category.
	•	GET /info
Retrieve model performance metrics, feature importance, and API documentation.

Input & Output Format

Example JSON Input for /predict:

{
  "gender": "Female",
  "age": 68,
  "hypertension": 1,
  "heart_disease": 0,
  "ever_married": "Yes",
  "work_type": "Private",
  "Residence_type": "Urban",
  "avg_glucose_level": 150.2,
  "bmi": 29.7,
  "smoking_status": "Formerly smoked"
}

Example JSON Output:

{
  "stroke_probability": 0.28,
  "risk_category": "High Risk",
  "confidence_interval": [0.21, 0.35],
  "model_version": "v1.0"
}

Model Details
	•	Training Set: 70% stratified split with class balancing via ROSE.
	•	Validation: 5-fold cross-validation, AUC as main metric.
	•	Deployment: Plumber RESTful API in R.
	•	Preprocessing: Median imputation for missing BMI, categorical encoding, standardization.

⸻

Performance & Limitations
	•	ROC AUC: High (see /info endpoint for latest metric)
	•	Sensitivity & Specificity: Balanced for clinical relevance
	•	Feature Importance: Age, glucose, hypertension, heart disease, BMI
	•	Limitations:
	•	Model performance may vary outside the original demographic scope
	•	Predictions are point-in-time, not longitudinal
	•	Not all possible clinical risk factors included

⸻

Recommendations
	•	Integrate with Electronic Health Records for clinical workflows
	•	Train providers in risk communication and model interpretation
	•	Use in conjunction with clinical guidelines—not as a sole decision-maker
	•	Plan for regular revalidation and retraining with new data
